So far this is just a proof-of-concept.

1. Install exmpp, https://support.process-one.net/doc/display/EXMPP/Installation+guide
   Or, simply, run
      ./configure && make && sudo make install
   in the deps/exmpp directory

2. Run make in the exb directory

3. Rename config.in to config. Set the appropriate options

4. Run
      erl -pz ebin

5. Run
      application:start(exb).

6. You can now "chat" to your bot (it will send back all you send to it)

   That is, if your bot is set up to use bot@server.org, simply add this contact
   to your contact list and chat away
